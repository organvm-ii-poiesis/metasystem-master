## Common Questions

### How do I set up a local development environment?

See the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for prerequisites and setup instructions.

### What's the minimum latency I can expect?

Our validated proof-of-concept achieves **2ms P95 latency** for input-to-output. Real-world performance depends on:
- Network conditions
- Number of concurrent audience members
- Server hardware
- Geographic distribution of participants

### Can I use this for [specific art form]?

The engine is designed to be genre-agnostic. Current implementations focus on music synthesis, but the architecture supports dance, theater, opera, and visual art through genre-specific modules.

### Is this production-ready?

Not yet. The project is in active development. Core functionality is validated but APIs may change.

## Response Times

This is a volunteer-maintained project. We aim to respond to issues within 7 days, but cannot guarantee timelines. Critical security issues are prioritized.
