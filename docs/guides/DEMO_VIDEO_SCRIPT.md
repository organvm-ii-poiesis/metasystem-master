## "The Stage That Breathes"
**Duration:** 90 Seconds

### [0:00 - 0:20] THE PROBLEM
**SCENE:** PASSIVE AUDIENCE
**VISUAL:** High-contrast, slow-motion footage of an audience at a traditional concert. Everyone is looking forward, static. Cut to a close-up of an audience member looking slightly bored or disconnected.
**VOICEOVER:** In every concert, in every play, there is a wall. A silent agreement that the artist speaks and the audience merely listens. But what if that silence was actually a missed signal? What if the collective energy of a thousand people could be captured and used as a brush?
**MUSIC:** Low, ominous cello drone. Very minimal.

### [0:20 - 0:50] THE SOLUTION
**SCENE:** THE ENGINE IN ACTION
**VISUAL:** Transition to a clean, digital aesthetic. Show a person opening the Omni-Dromenon web app on their phone. They move a slider. Instantly, on a large screen in the background, a generative visual pattern shifts in sync.
**VOICEOVER:** Introducing the Omni-Dromenon Machina. A high-performance engine that transforms audience interaction into a living control signal. Using our weighted consensus algorithm, we aggregate discrete mobile inputs into a single, high-fidelity stream with just 2 milliseconds of latency.
**MUSIC:** Pulse starts to build. Synthesizer arpeggio enters, rhythmic and precise.

### [0:50 - 1:20] THE IMPACT
**SCENE:** RECIPROCAL CREATION
**VISUAL:** Split screen. On the left, a performer (dancer or musician) reacting to a change in the environment. On the right, a heat-map of audience inputs shifting. Show the "Performer Override" dashboard being used to gently guide the chaos.
**VOICEOVER:** This isn't just a gadget. It's a new vocabulary for the stage. Performers maintain creative authority, while audiences gain genuine agency. It’s a reciprocal loop—a stage that breathes with its spectators, scaling from intimate galleries to stadium-sized events.
**MUSIC:** The track hits its peak. Orchestral elements blend with electronic textures. Uplifting and cinematic.

### [1:20 - 1:30] CALL TO ACTION
**SCENE:** LOGO & LINKS
**VISUAL:** Clean white logo on black background: OMNI-DROMENON-ENGINE.

**VOICEOVER:** The architecture is live. The documentation is open. Join us in building the next evolution of live performance.
**MUSIC:** Music cuts to a single, resonant note. Fade to black.

### NOTES:
- **Tone:** Converational but authoritative.
- **Visuals:** Use high-quality screen captures of the Performance SDK for the "Solution" section.
- **Lighting:** Warm, theatrical lighting for the performer shots; cool, tech-focused lighting for the mobile interface shots.
