## Funding Strategy Recommendations

### Short-Term (Next 90 Days)
1. **Submit to Ars Electronica STARTS** (Mar 1) - High visibility, low funding, but network value
2. **Begin NSF Creative IT application** (Apr 15) - Highest funding potential

### Medium-Term (90-180 Days)
3. **Submit to NEH Digital Humanities** (Jun 1) - Good fallback if NSF requires affiliation
4. **Approach Knight Foundation** (Rolling) - Less competitive, more flexible

### Long-Term (Post-POC)
5. **Build European consortium** for Creative Europe (Sep 15)
6. **Apply for residencies** once work is demonstrable

---

## Gaps in This Analysis

1. **Geographic coverage** - No non-US, non-EU sources (Australia Council, Japan Foundation needed)
2. **Private foundations** - Only Knight identified (explore Mellon, Ford, Bloomberg)
3. **Residencies** - None identified (Eyebeam, NEW INC, Pioneer Works are strong options)
4. **Corporate sponsorship** - Not explored (tech companies with arts programs)
