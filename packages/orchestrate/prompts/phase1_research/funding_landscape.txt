## PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA
Rank opportunities by:
1. **Deadline proximity** (next 3-6 months = highest priority)
2. **Alignment score** (4-5 = pursue immediately)
3. **Effort-to-reward ratio** (smaller grants for validation vs. large grants for scale)
4. **Strategic sequencing** (which grants build credibility for larger ones?)

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Verify all URLs are current and accessible
- Note if any programs have been discontinued or restructured
- Flag opportunities that require institutional affiliation (may need partnership)
- Identify "gateway" grants (smaller amounts that unlock larger opportunities)
- Include at least 3 opportunities with deadlines in the next 90 days
