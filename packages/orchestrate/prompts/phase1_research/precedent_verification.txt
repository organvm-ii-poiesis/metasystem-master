## PHASE 1a: PRECEDENT VERIFICATION
## Service: Perplexity
## Purpose: Validate existing claims about audience-driven performance systems

You are validating research for an academic project on audience-driven adaptive performance systems.

## CONTEXT
Project: Omni-Performative Engine
Goal: Unified platform enabling real-time audience-performer co-creation across genres

## EXISTING PRECEDENT CLAIMS TO VERIFY
{precedent_claims}

## TASK
For EACH claim listed above, provide:

### 1. SOURCE VERIFICATION
- **Primary Source**: (Academic paper DOI, official documentation URL, verified interview citation)
- **Source Quality**: (Peer-reviewed | Official Documentation | Verified Interview | Secondary Source | Unverified)
- **Access Date**: (When source was last verified accessible)

### 2. CLAIM ACCURACY
- **Verification Status**: (Confirmed | Partially Confirmed | Contradicted | Unverifiable)
- **Actual Finding**: (What the source actually says, if different from claim)
- **Discrepancy Notes**: (If any mismatch between claim and source)

### 3. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
- **Related Systems**: (Other projects using similar technology/approach)
- **Technical Specifications**: (Concrete numbers: latency, scale, resolution if available)
- **Limitations Noted**: (What the source identifies as constraints)

### 4. NOVELTY ASSESSMENT
- **Gap Identified**: (What is missing from this precedent that Omni-PE addresses?)
- **Overlap Risk**: (Could this be seen as prior art? How differentiated is Omni-PE?)

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Return results in both:
1. **JSON** (for parsing): Array of verification objects
2. **Markdown** (for human review): Formatted report with citations

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- Prioritize academic and official sources over news articles or blog posts
- Flag any claim that cannot be verified with a primary source
- Note when specifications are estimated vs. documented
- Identify if any precedents have been discontinued or superseded
