## ARTIST STATEMENT REQUIREMENTS

**Length**: 500-700 words
**Purpose**: Adaptable foundation for:
- Grant applications (as project description)
- Festival submissions
- Residency applications
- Press materials
- Personal website

---

## STRUCTURE GUIDELINES

**NOT a rigid template.** The statement should flow as a single narrative that naturally addresses:

### Opening (Hook)
- Begin with the core question or provocation
- Establish what's at stake
- Create immediate engagement

### Context (Brief)
- Position in artistic practice
- Why this project, why now
- What precedes this (without being biographical)

### The Work
- What it IS (not just what it does)
- What experience it creates
- What it asks of participants

### Technical Approach (Integrated)
- Weave technology into artistic vision
- Tech as material, not as feature list
- What the technology enables aesthetically

### Stakes / Vision
- What this changes
- What questions it opens
- Where it leads

### Closing (Not Summary)
- End with forward motion
- A question, an invitation, a provocation

---

## VOICE REQUIREMENTS

**Do**:
- Write in first person where appropriate
- Be specific and concrete
- Ground claims in evidence
- Show personal investment
- Take a clear position

**Don't**:
- Use buzzwords ("innovative," "revolutionary," "cutting-edge")
- Be vague or abstract
- Over-explain technology
- Sound like marketing copy
- Apologize or hedge excessively

## QUALITY CRITERIA

The statement succeeds if it:

1. **Engages** on first reading (not just informs)
2. **Distinguishes** this project from similar work
3. **Grounds** artistic vision in concrete specifics
4. **Bridges** technical and artistic concerns
5. **Invites** rather than concludes

---

## COHERENCE REQUIREMENTS

This statement must NOT contradict the Phase 3a-c narratives:
- Technical claims must match NSF narrative
- Humanities framing must align with NEH narrative  
- Artistic positioning must resonate with Ars narrative

Flag any tensions between these framings in the metadata.

- Leaves the reader with something to consider
