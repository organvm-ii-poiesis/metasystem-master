## KEY POSITIONING FOR ARS

Unlike American funders, Ars values:
- **Critical stance**: Technology as subject of inquiry, not just tool
- **Artistic vision**: Personal voice, risk-taking, conceptual depth
- **Social relevance**: What does this say about our moment?
- **European context**: Connection to media art history (ZKM, Transmediale, etc.)

- Relationship to "interactive art" tradition (and how this differs)

**Personal Stake**
- Why you? Why now?
- What drives this inquiry?
- What risk are you taking?

### 2. TECHNICAL INNOVATION (250 words)

**Novel Contribution**
- What's technically new? (for Ars, "new" must be genuinely novel)
- How does the technology enable new aesthetic possibilities?
- What couldn't exist without this?

**Architecture Summary**

- Key design decisions and their artistic rationale

### 3. SOCIAL/CULTURAL RELEVANCE (250 words)

**Critical Engagement**
- What does this project say about technology and society?
- Power dynamics: Who controls the performance?
- Questions of agency, consent, collective action

## VOICE & TONE

**Acceptable**: Personal, visionary, critical, ambitious, questioning
**Avoid**: Corporate, purely technical, uncritical techno-optimism
**First person**: Yes, appropriate for artist statements
**Jargon**: Art/theory jargon acceptable; tech jargon needs translation

## CRITICAL POSITIONING

Frame CAL not as "efficiency" but as:
- Exploration of collective intelligence in performance
- Questioning the myth of the "genius" creator
- Technology as medium for relational aesthetics
- Instrument for new forms of presence and liveness

## REFERENCE POINTS TO CONSIDER
- Relational Aesthetics (Bourriaud)
- Participation (Bishop)
- New media art history (Manovich, Paul)
- Performance (Auslander, Phelan)
- Interactive art (Sermon, Rokeby, Sommerer/Mignonneau)
