## NEH DIGITAL HUMANITIES REQUIREMENTS

**Program Focus**: Technology in service of humanities research and public engagement
**Typical Winners**: University-based projects, strong humanities framing, public benefit
**Winning Messaging**: "expanding access to cultural heritage" + "new forms of scholarly inquiry"
**Common Weaknesses**: Tech-forward projects that forget the humanities; weak evaluation plans

---

## KEY REFRAMING FOR NEH

Unlike NSF (technology-first), NEH requires **humanities-first** framing:
- Lead with cultural/scholarly questions, not technical innovation
- Position technology as tool, not end goal
- Emphasize public benefit and accessibility
- Connect to humanities disciplines (performance studies, musicology, theater studies)

## WRITING GUIDELINES

**Voice**: Scholarly but accessible; rigorous but not dense
**Framing**: Technology enables humanities inquiry (not the reverse)
**Citations**: Reference humanities scholars (Auslander, Phelan, Taylor, etc.)
**Audience**: Humanities review panel (may be skeptical of tech-heavy proposals)

## CRITICAL REFRAMES
- "Real-time consensus algorithm" → "collective meaning-making in performance"
- "Multi-modal input processing" → "sensing the full dimension of human expression"
- "Scalable architecture" → "accessible to diverse communities and venues"
