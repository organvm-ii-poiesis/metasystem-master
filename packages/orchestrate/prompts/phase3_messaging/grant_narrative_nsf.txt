## NSF CREATIVE IT REQUIREMENTS

**Program Focus**: Novel computational methods with social/cultural impact
**Typical Winners**: Cross-disciplinary teams, academic + industry partnerships
**Winning Messaging**: "democratizing creative technology" + "open-source models"
**Common Weaknesses**: Underestimated timelines, overstated adoption claims

---

## NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (2 pages, NSF format)

### 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT (1 paragraph, ~200 words)

Write a compelling problem statement that addresses:
- **Current state**: What is broken/limited in live performance today?
- **Why it matters**: Stakes for performers, audiences, culture
- **Why it's hard**: Technical and creative challenges
- **Why now**: What makes this moment ripe for intervention?

**Tone**: Urgent but grounded; avoid hyperbole
**Evidence**: Reference validated precedents from Phase 1

### 2. PROPOSED SOLUTION (1.5 pages, ~750 words)

#### 2.1 Core Innovation: CAL (Contextual Awareness Layer)
- What it is (one paragraph, accessible to reviewers)
- Algorithmic contribution (what's novel computationally?)
- Theoretical contribution (what's novel conceptually?)

#### 2.2 Architecture Overview
- High-level system diagram (describe in text for later visualization)
- Key components and their interactions
- Why this architecture vs. alternatives?

#### 2.3 Novelty Claim
- How Omni-PE differs from existing systems (cite Phase 1 precedents)
- What specific gap does it fill?
- Contribution to HCI/music computing/performance studies fields

#### 2.4 Proof-of-Concept Timeline (12 months)
- Quarter-by-quarter milestones
- Deliverables at each stage
- Risk mitigation built into timeline

### 3. BROADER IMPACTS (0.5 pages, ~250 words)

#### 3.1 Beneficiaries
- Artists and performers (creative empowerment)
- Technologists (open tools, new paradigms)
- Audiences (agency, engagement)
- Institutions (new programming possibilities)

#### 3.2 Dissemination Plan
- Open-source repository (license, community model)
- Academic publication targets (specific venues)
- Workshops and tutorials (venues, audiences)

#### 3.3 Educational Component
- Curriculum integration possibilities
- Toolkit for artists/developers
- Accessibility considerations

### 4. QUALIFICATIONS & RESOURCES (brief, ~100 words)
- Why this team/individual is positioned to succeed
- Institutional support (if any)
- Preliminary work completed

## WRITING GUIDELINES

**Voice**: Confident but not arrogant; precise but not jargon-heavy
**Evidence**: Every major claim should reference Phase 1/2 findings
**Specificity**: Use concrete numbers, timelines, deliverables
**Accessibility**: Write for intelligent non-specialists (diverse review panels)
**Structure**: Clear topic sentences; one idea per paragraph

## AVOID
- Vague claims ("revolutionary", "unprecedented") without evidence
- Overpromising on timeline or adoption
- Ignoring limitations or risks
- Field-specific jargon without explanation
- Passive voice where active is clearer
