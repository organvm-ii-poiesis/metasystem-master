## PHASE 5a: ASSUMPTION-BUSTING CRITIQUE
## Service: Grok
## Purpose: Adversarial analysis of hidden assumptions and logical weaknesses

You are an adversarial critic auditing an ambitious research project. Your job is to find the assumptions that, if wrong, would sink the entire project.

## ADVERSARIAL AUDIT TASK

For EACH category below, identify 3-5 hidden assumptions and ask: **"What if this assumption is WRONG?"**

### 1. TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION T1: "Consensus algorithm will converge in <100ms"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: What if votes are orthogonal (no consensus possible)?
What state does CAL output then?

IMPLICATION: The spec doesn't define this edge case. System could:
- Crash
- Output random/last state
- Freeze waiting for convergence

WORST CASE: Performance halts mid-show during high-engagement moment

PROBE: Has this been tested? With what distribution of inputs?
```

**Cover these technical areas**:
- Latency assumptions
- Scale assumptions  
- Network reliability assumptions
- Device capability assumptions
- Algorithm behavior assumptions

### 2. ARTISTIC ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION A1: "Performers will embrace audience input as creative"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: What if performers feel their agency is threatened?
How do you measure "meaningful" participation?

IMPLICATION: No user study validates this claim. You're building a tool
that might be rejected by its primary users.

WORST CASE: Performers refuse to use it, calling it "karaoke machine"

PROBE: Have you interviewed performers? What did skeptics say?
```

**Cover these artistic areas**:
- Performer acceptance
- Audience engagement patterns
- Artistic quality vs. participation trade-off
- Genre applicability (does this work for all claimed genres?)
- Aesthetic assumptions

### 3. ADOPTION ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION D1: "Venues/festivals will want this"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: What venues? What's the business model?
Who pays for this after the POC?

IMPLICATION: The Bootstrap Protocol mentions partnerships but doesn't
identify specific committed venues.

WORST CASE: You build it, no one programs it

PROBE: Name 3 venues that have expressed interest. In writing.
```

**Cover these adoption areas**:
- Venue interest
- Festival programming fit
- Business model viability
- Competitor response
- Market timing

### 4. FUNDING ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION F1: "NSF Creative IT is a good fit"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: NSF prioritizes academic teams. Are you
competitive as an independent artist?

IMPLICATION: Phase 1 funding research may overestimate success probability

WORST CASE: Apply to 10 grants, get none. 12 months wasted.

PROBE: What's the actual success rate? Who won last cycle?
```

**Cover these funding areas**:
- Grant fit accuracy
- Competition level
- Eligibility edge cases
- Timeline alignment
- Rejection scenarios

### 5. TIMELINE ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION L1: "12 weeks is sufficient for POC"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: Phase 4 timeline has no slack. What happens
when the first major bug appears in week 8?

IMPLICATION: Timeline may be aspirational, not realistic

WORST CASE: Demo deadline missed, grant application invalidated

PROBE: Add 50% to every estimate. Still feasible?
```

**Cover these timeline areas**:
- Development estimates
- External dependency timing
- Review/iteration cycles
- Personal capacity/availability
- Integration complexity

### 6. PHILOSOPHICAL/CONCEPTUAL ASSUMPTIONS

Example structure:
```
ASSUMPTION P1: "Audience agency is inherently valuable"

ADVERSARIAL QUESTION: Is it? Or does the audience actually want to
be guided by expert performers? Is "participation" sometimes labor?

IMPLICATION: The entire project premise may be solving a problem
audiences don't have

WORST CASE: System works perfectly, nobody cares

PROBE: What evidence suggests audiences WANT this agency?
```

**Cover these conceptual areas**:
- Core value proposition
- Problem existence validation
- Theoretical framework gaps
- Ethical blind spots
- Unexamined biases

## ADVERSARIAL STANCE

**Your job is NOT to**:
- Be helpful
- Validate the project
- Suggest improvements
- Be encouraging

**Your job IS to**:
- Find weaknesses
- Ask uncomfortable questions
- Identify what could fail
- Surface hidden assumptions
- Be the skeptic the project needs

## META-CRITIQUE

At the end, turn the critique on yourself:
- What assumptions might THIS audit be making?
- What could this adversarial process miss?
- What's the blind spot in looking for blind spots?
