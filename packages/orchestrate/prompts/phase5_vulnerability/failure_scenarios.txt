## PHASE 5b: FAILURE SCENARIO MODELING
## Service: Grok
## Purpose: Model concrete failure scenarios and their cascading effects

You are modeling failure scenarios for a complex project. Your job is to imagine specific, plausible ways this project could fail and trace the consequences.

## FAILURE SCENARIO TASK

Generate 10 detailed failure scenarios across these categories:

### CATEGORY A: TECHNICAL FAILURES (3 scenarios)

For each scenario, use this structure:

```
SCENARIO T-FAIL-1: "The Cascade Crash"

TRIGGER EVENT:
During a live performance with 2,000 audience members, a network spike
causes consensus algorithm to enter oscillation state.

INITIAL FAILURE:
CAL outputs contradictory states in rapid succession (100ms intervals)

CASCADE SEQUENCE:
1. [T+0ms] Consensus enters oscillation
2. [T+100ms] Performer UI shows flickering parameters
3. [T+500ms] Audio engine receives conflicting commands
4. [T+1s] SuperCollider outputs harsh digital artifacts
5. [T+2s] Performer manually kills audio
6. [T+5s] Audience confusion, some leave
7. [T+30s] Performance halted for "technical difficulties"

OBSERVABLE SYMPTOMS:
- What performer sees: [description]
- What audience sees: [description]
- What system logs show: [description]

RECOVERY OPTIONS:
- Immediate: [action, time to recover]
- Short-term: [action, time to recover]
- Long-term fix: [architectural change needed]

PROBABILITY: Medium (network spikes are common in venues)
IMPACT: High (public failure, reputational damage)

PREVENTION:
- [Specific technical safeguard]
- [Monitoring/alerting needed]

POST-MORTEM QUESTIONS:
- Could this have been caught in testing?
- What data would help diagnose this?
- Who needs to be notified?
```

### CATEGORY B: ARTISTIC FAILURES (2 scenarios)

Example scenario types:
- Performer revolt (refuses to use system mid-project)
- Audience disengagement (participation dies)
- Aesthetic failure (works technically, sounds/looks bad)
- Genre mismatch (works for music, fails for theater)

### CATEGORY C: ADOPTION FAILURES (2 scenarios)

Example scenario types:
- Venue rejection (no one programs it)
- Festival mismatch (accepted but wrong context)
- Collaborator withdrawal (key partner exits)
- Market timing failure (similar product launches first)

### CATEGORY D: FUNDING FAILURES (2 scenarios)

Example scenario types:
- Grant rejection cascade (all applications fail)
- Funding gap (grant too small for scope)
- Delayed funding (timeline misalignment)
- Strings attached (funder requirements conflict with vision)

### CATEGORY E: PERSONAL/CAPACITY FAILURES (1 scenario)

Example scenario types:
- Burnout
- Life event interruption
- Skill gap discovery
- Motivation collapse

## FOR EACH SCENARIO, PROVIDE:

### 1. Scenario Card
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| ID | X-FAIL-N |
| Name | Evocative short name |
| Category | Technical / Artistic / Adoption / Funding / Personal |
| Trigger | Specific initiating event |
| Probability | Low / Medium / High |
| Impact | Low / Medium / High / Catastrophic |
| Detection Time | When you'd notice |
| Recovery Time | How long to fix |

### 2. Narrative (100-200 words)
Tell the story of how this failure unfolds, step by step.

### 3. Cascade Map
```
[Trigger] 
    → [First failure]
        → [Second-order effect]
            → [Third-order effect]
                → [Final state]
```

### 4. Warning Signs
What signals would appear BEFORE this failure manifests?

### 5. Contingency Plan
If this happens, what's the response playbook?

### 6. Lessons
What does this scenario teach about the project design?

---

## SCENARIO INTERACTION ANALYSIS

After generating all 10 scenarios, analyze:

### Failure Clusters
Which scenarios could trigger each other?
```
T-FAIL-1 (cascade crash) could trigger:
  → A-FAIL-2 (performer revolt) if happens repeatedly
  → D-FAIL-1 (funding failure) if happens during demo
```

### Common Root Causes
What underlying issues appear across multiple scenarios?

### Resilience Gaps
Where is the project most fragile? What's the weakest link?

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS

1. **What's the nightmare scenario?** The one failure that would end the project?
2. **What would you not survive twice?** Some failures you can recover from once.
3. **What's the "silent failure"?** Working technically but failing artistically?
4. **What's the "success disaster"?** Too much attention before you're ready?
